# LIRI Bot ðŸ‘¾

### Overview

IRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters, calls Bands in Town, Spotify or the OMDB API to give the user back information based on the parameters given.

### Functionality Breakdown
1. User calls the node file in the command line and types one of the following commands
    1. concert-this
    2. spotify-this-song
    3. movie-this
    4. do-what-it-says
    
2. Each command will do the following:
    1. Call a function that initiates Inquirer to prompt the user a question about what they want to search
    2. Once the user has input the answer, it will run an API call
    3. All API keys are hidden in a .gitignore and retrieved through requiring the correct .js file then referencing .env file hidden in the .gitignore.
    3. Data is retrieved from the API then appended to a .txt file
    4. Finally the data is displayed to the user in the terminal
    
### Technology Used
1. Node-Spotify-API
